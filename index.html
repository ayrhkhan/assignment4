          <p id="intro">
            Cohesion is something I strive for in my day to day life. However my wardrobe doesn’t reflect the same level of cohesion that I would like. At the beginning of 2020 I started a Pinterest board to give me an idea of the clothes that I like the most but then COvid. This my opportunity to bring together my ideas.

        <div class="Tops">



          <h2>Tops</h2>



          <div class="row">
            <div class="column">
              <p class="description">Going through the board I find more tan neutrals than gray and white. I like the texture of clothing as well as draping in clothing that is more structured. Fitted tops with different lengths paired with baggy pants or oversized shirts with shorts or leggings. I like colored tops, symmetrical line structures as well.</p>

        <div class="Bottoms">
          <h2>Bottoms</h2>


          <div class="row">
            <div class="column">
              <p class="description">Athleisure is prevalent in sweats and leggings. Cargo pants make frequent appearance. Biker shorts and skirts. I don’t see as many jeans as I would have assumed to be saved but I don’t really like jeans so that makes sense. For pant color I see a ton of black, with colored detailing. While I don’t like my clothes to say things the accents on pants are color oriented rather than brand.</p>

        <div class="Accessories">
          <h2> Accessories</h2>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="column">
              <p class="description">Accessories are on the board by  coincidence rather than intentionally.  I would like to put  more intention in with Accessories.  I see necklaces between 16 to 18 inches. As well as fannypacks used as cross body as well as waist belts. Chunky boots and sneakers are shoes of choice.</p>

            Going through the board I leave with a better understanding of where I would like to go with my color scheme as well as the sizing I will be going towards.
